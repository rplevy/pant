* Propositions Are Not Types: Naturalizing Information Content in Computing

  Overview: "the hard problem of content" (Hutto & Myin, 2013) is an
  argument that information as it exists in physical systems is only
  covariance information, which does not inherently have properties
  such as truth, reference, and implication required for it to work as
  propositional content.  That means formal propositions implemented
  in computing systems can't actually be carriers of content as
  information-processing theorists had hoped.  But in order for
  software engineering to mature into reliable practice, we will need
  computing systems to participate in propositional activities on our
  behalf.  Following Hutto & Myin's solution that real-world content
  depends on shared scaffolded practices that augment basic agents, we
  explore socially situated computing as an approach to naturalizing
  information content in computing.

** Part I: Propositions are Not Types

   Over the last decade or so a research finding that was previously
   heard mostly in university math and computer science departments
   has become a popular slogan in applied statically typed functional
   programming circles.  The message that inspires this movement:
   "propositions are types!  programs are proofs!"  It's not a new
   idea that leading figures such as Philip Wadler and Simon Peyton
   Jones promote, it is a well-established finding that unfolded over
   a period from 1934 to 1969 in the work of mathematicians Haskell
   Curry and William Alvin Howard.  From a purely mathematical
   standpoint there is nothing false about the Curry-Howard
   Correspondence as it is called.  It is indeed useful, as it allows
   computer programs to be analyzed using the tools of formal logic,
   everything from proof assistants to compile-time type-checkers in
   general-purpose programming languages.  Pretty neat.

   Where we start to run into problems is that the emboldened typed
   functional language communities increasingly advocate for a radical
   perspective on logic and information processing that is reminiscent
   of the symbolic processing era of AI.  Their hope or expectation is
   that the programs-as-proofs approach will scale to messier, more
   complex real-world applications of formal methods, transforming
   computing from the status of unreliable and irresponsible craft to
   robust engineering discipline.  The goal of being able to declare
   what our systems must abide by and hold to is laudable and I share
   it, but the means to that goal brush over some thorny problems.

** Lessons from Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science

   Computationalism or "GOFAI" did not exactly die when it failed
   spectacularly in the mid-80s, but in the time since the AI winter
   there has been progress on understanding why such approaches are
   bound to fail.  As new research on pre-AI cybernetics-era
   techniques such as neural networks began to show improvements,
   "symbol grounding" was identified as an overlooked problem with
   formal propositional systems.  The symbol grounding problem is that
   symbols' interpretations are not intrinsic to formal systems, but
   rather depend on users of a system to assign their meanings.
   Consider how any property of the world is encoded as data.  Symbol
   grounding problems arise due to encoding of properties and events
   in ways that arbitrarily coincide with human interpretation, but do
   not intrinsically preserve lawful relationships to aspects of the
   world.  Today computationalists in AI seem to be excited about
   combining the more grounded behaviors of neural networks with
   symbolic processing ideas, but symbol grounding remains a difficult
   problem for the information-processing paradigm generally.

** The Hard Problem of Content

   But there is an even deeper problem with information processing
   approaches to information content.  Fred Dretske, the thinker
   perhaps most emblematic of the original computationalism, proposed
   that a "cognitive" system (meaning a system acting on information
   content) is one that converts analog information into a digital
   representation, and performs manipulations on that digital
   information, allowing it to perform actions targeting properties of
   its environment.  Dretske's notion of information is that data
   indicates or carries information about some property of the world
   if the two vary lawfully enough.  Recently Dretske's theory of
   content has met with a strong challenge from cognitive science
   philosophers Daniel Hutto and Erik Myin, that such accounts of
   content have no grounds on which to claim that lawfully covarying
   information "says" or "represents" anything about the world.  This
   observation which they refer to as the "hard problem of content" or
   the "covariance-is-not-content principle" is that systems acting on
   covariance information, while acting on information, do not
   constitute content-bearing systems, because to bear content is to
   embody claims about how things stand, when in fact they merely
   embody capacities to affect the world.

   So even a well-grounded symbol is not intrinsically about anything,
   it cannot be about something, it only lawfully varies in relation
   to some property of the world.  The consequence of this for the
   design of computing systems is that we shouldn't expect to find a
   way for computing systems much less biological agents to work with
   self-contained information-as-content when all we've given them is
   information-as-covariance lacking any way of participating in its
   larger social/pragmatic context.  What we should look for instead
   are ways of scaffolding propositional interactions in effective
   world-involving ways.  As Wittgenstein surmised after a career
   spent grappling with the basic nature of propositions, propositions
   themselves do not contain information about how things stand,
   rather they are like moves in games where the object is to know how
   things stand in the world.

** Part II: Naturalizing Information Content

   We've talked about covariance information, and how it is not the
   same thing as information content, but how can we naturalize
   content?  In order to answer that, it is necessary to take a step
   back from a narrow focus on abstract information, and look at
   human-computer interaction, which is a special case of
   human-environment interaction.  We will touch briefly on how basic
   agents use information effectively and produce it expressively, and
   then discuss how convention-based access to such information (via
   cooperative scaffolding of motivated attentional decisions) is
   leveraged in claim-making games-- and how socially situated
   computing systems can participate in these "games", reaping the
   benefits of participating in authentic information content.

** Lawful and Conventional Access to Ecological Information

   Embodied cognitive science research has shown that covariance
   information, while content-free and non-representational, can go a
   long way in explaining a host of complex cognitive behaviors.  The
   most scientifically mature effort in embodied cognitive science is
   ecological psychology, founded by J. J. Gibson in the 1950s, 60s,
   and 70s.  Ecological psychology has made as much progress as it has
   on naturalizing phenomenology by discovering that organisms acquire
   "ecological information", information supporting perception/action,
   in the form of learning to exploit what are called "affordances" or
   physical properties of the environment that reliably specify
   directly realizable actions/outcomes to organisms.  Ecological
   information is law-based covariance information embodied by
   organisms guided by affordances in their prospective control and
   navigation of environments.

   But ecological information supporting the control of action can be
   accessed in a secondary way, by means of convention, as Sabrina
   Golonka published in 2015.  Research has found that only law-based
   information can support direct perception, but conventions such as
   signs and gestures can be used to select or steer attention to a
   primary target of direct perception, and as such constitute a mode
   of access to ecological information.  Importantly, such expressive
   conventions do not constitute content and representation.  As Jos√©
   Medina (2013) puts it, basic convention-based expression "should
   not be understood on the Gricean model of conventional signs, that
   is, as involving or requiring fully formed communicative intentions
   and internal representations. Expressive behavior is not
   self-reflective intentional-referential behavior among rational
   agents who are representing each other's minds and their contents."
   Rather, conventional expression is a mechanism of directing
   attention.

** Joint Attention, Scaffolding, and Claim-making

   Conventionality does not in itself grant such sophisticated uses as
   representing content, rather it serves as the foundation for them.
   As Hutto & Myin (2017) write:

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     "content only arises when special sorts of sociocultural norms
     are in place.  The norms in question depend on the development,
     maintenance, and stabilization of practices involving the use of
     public symbol systems through which the biologically inherited
     cognitive capacities can be scaffolded in particular ways.  The
     practices in question are claim-making practices-- and they are
     special because they require participants not only to respond to
     things but to do so by /representing them as being thus and so/
     independently of what might be said about them." (italics theirs)

     ...

     "Getting things wrong in a truly representational sense is not
     just a matter of being literally misguided in the way purely
     biological entities and creatures can be. It involves being
     subject to the censure of others-- not just in the sense of being
     in or out of line with what is acceptable or not for some
     community, but being able to get things wrong in a game in which
     it is at least possible to be right according to how things are
     anyway. Only those in a position to play this sort of game can be
     said to have content-involving thoughts and speech."
   #+END_QUOTE

   So then what does this socially situated "scaffolding" of basic
   direct and conventional access to ecological information require?
   The most empirically compelling answer to this question is to be
   found in Michael Tomasello's research on primates and child
   development.  Tomasello has found that primates use gestural
   conventions classified into two categories: "attention-movement"
   gestures, to get another agent to do a particular thing, and
   "attention-getter" gestures that call attention of another agent to
   something that they'll respond to in some way.  Humans in contrast
   (at around 9 months of age) develop a more powerful vocabulary of
   social attention control devices.  Humans go through three stages
   of learning how to control attention.  The first is "sharing" what
   they are attending to, not unlike the attention-getter techniques
   of apes.  The second is "following into", as in attending to what
   another agent is attending to.  The third developmental stage is
   the skill of "directing" others to attend.  Directing is the most
   impressive skill out of the three because unlike the
   attention-mover gestures of the great apes, directing attention
   occurs relative to a followed-into shared context of attending.  It
   is worth noting that these social skills appear several years
   earlier in child development than the "theory of mind" skills.
   Because of their early development and marked divergence from other
   primates' functionally similar abilities, Tomasello theorizes that
   they constitute an innate and evolved "infrastructure of shared
   intentionality" supporting cooperative communication that paves the
   way for complex tools of cooperation such as spoken language.

   The development of joint attentional skills was a defining moment
   in becoming human as we know it.  It made it possible for humans to
   construct attentional tools (paintings, glyphs, models etc) that
   augmented their gestural scaffolding of attention.  Such
   scaffolding devices included the development of language itself, in
   which verbal constructions are literally used as tools.  With joint
   attention, and its augmentation by scaffolding, we approach the
   aforementioned Gricean account of communication as prosocial,
   cooperative activity. This gives us the necessary ingredients for
   the social construction of claim-making scenarios, such that one
   might play the game and be successful or fail, with a given
   propositional move, at achieving socially defined objectives in a
   shared environment.

** Scaffolding, Constructions, and Conceptual Metaphor

   I would like to take a moment here to revisit the insufficiency of
   the formal propositional account of information content that is the
   focus of Part 1 of this article.  There is a potential objection to
   our positive neo-Wittgensteinian account (that propositions are
   less like pictures or containers, and more like moves played in
   games), the objection being that any such game moves can only be
   smaller fragments of world models, and that the problem has simply
   shifted to a finer grain.  We have already seen one way in which
   that is not the case, that is in pre-linguistic deictic social
   skills of joint attentional engagement.  But that is not yet true
   claim-making, so what of the scenario of mature claim-making
   contexts?  The fact is that the objection ignores that language
   even in its simplest cases does not consist in formal world
   modeling but in guiding and motivating flows of attention in a
   collaborative process of narrative sense-making.  For consistency,
   I will assume the usage-based model of language constructions
   (Tomasello 2003, Goldberg 2006) as tools (which I also happen
   believe is true, given its elegance and empirical track record.)
   Humans are at base engaged in joint attention for the purpose of
   cooperating on activities, and language affords powerful leverage
   in those processes.  As an example, around 2-3 years of age
   children begin to pick up on identification and possession
   constructions like "it is X", "that is X", and "that's my X". Using
   these constructions is to participate in engaged processes,
   supporting them by calling attention to something someone would
   presumably want to know.  Further, it has long been
   well-established scientifically that conceptual metaphor (Ortony
   1993), the practice of adapting familiar schemas from basic-level
   perception to make sense of or define more abstract or complex
   ideas.  Conceptual metaphor is a an application of joint
   attentional scaffolding that human languages get a great deal of
   mileage out of. Again, this is a way of resolving sense-making to
   flows of motivated attention.  So it is not a deflective move to
   take the pragmatic turn on propositionality, rather it is to
   embrace the reality that cooperative attentional scaffolding is the
   basis of sense-making and communication, and that the claim-making
   scenario (where what is expressed may win or lose, be correct or
   incorrect) is no exception.

** Socially Situated Programming

   The picture we have arrived at is of human culture as a large-scale
   stigmergic content ecosystem, consisting in human social
   transaction within contexts of content generation, testing, and
   upkeep.  Individuals from a young age are confronted with the need
   to make myriad passive and active attentional decisions that become
   in some large part what is unique about the life experience,
   perspectives, and directions of any particular person.  As social
   creatures we enter a world that offers us a wealth of pre-existing
   tools for directing attention in useful ways, and games or systems
   establishing utility of actions.  Despite all of culture's
   complexity, there is always one thing happening that makes content
   possible: scaffolded processes of attending in game-like social
   contexts.

   For designers of interactive computing environments, including
   programming languages and other kinds of systems in need of
   open-ended declarative expression, the trillion-dollar question is:
   how can machines participate meaningfully and effectively in
   content?  I will present two answers to this, one too general for
   it to be immediately obvious how it might be put to use, and one
   too specific to imply any sort of claim about the space of other
   possible solutions-- just exploring one approach in some depth. It
   is left to the reader to experiment with other possibilities in
   this space.

   The very broad answer can be summarized as "socially situated
   computing". To define this I will start with defining the more
   encompassing "situated computing".  The idea of situated computing
   or situated programming is that computing is embedded more directly
   into situations than it traditionally has been, putting systems
   into shorter real-time feedback loops with events of interest to
   its users.  Rich Hickey has emphasized the importance of this
   embeddedness and feedback for creating reliably effective software
   systems, whereas others such as Jelle van Dijk, M Eifler, and Bret
   Victor have focused on the implications of immersive technologies
   on embodied engagement with direct environments as we experiment
   with a plethora of new kinds of devices, sensors, and
   instruments. Others such as William J. Clancey and Rodney Brooks
   have focused on the importance of environment embeddedness for the
   intelligence of artificial agents. The common theme in all of these
   approaches is a reorientation of computing to be more ubiquitously
   agent-centered, context-sensitive, and feedback-oriented.

   Phoebe Sengers (1996) coined the term ‚Äúsocially situated AI‚Äù to
   refer to approaches to AI that are not only aware of the agent's
   relationship to its physical environment, but also its social
   environment.  Expanding the scope of this idea a bit,
   social-world-involving software augmentation of experience is what
   I am calling socially situated computing. It is my contention that
   from an HCI perspective, an AI perspective, and a generally
   informatic perspective, embedding of computing into the contexts
   where content is maintained is a requirement in order to make
   systems content-aware.

** Narrative Process Scaffolding

   To answer the question posed earlier "how can machines participate
   meaningfully and effectively in content" with the broad brush of
   "socially situated computing" is at an appropriate level of
   generality in its non-commitment to specifics for the current state
   of the art, but at the same time it is unsatisfying because it
   doesn't get into specifically /how/ computing is to be involved in
   contexts where content is maintained.  As I see it, this problem
   has two sides to it: a causal decision science problem and a
   human-computer interaction problem-- and I believe they have one
   shared solution, one I have hinted at in discussing Tomasello and
   Carpenter's work on joint attention.  The attentional skills of
   sharing, following-into, and directing are intuitively accessible
   to 9-to-12-month old babies, so they make for an effective deictic
   vocabulary for scaffolding attention /in situ/.  This becomes a
   human-computer interaction model when we apply it as a way of
   instructionally scaffolding software agents acting on behalf of
   users, as an interface to machine-executed behaviors.  Software
   agents for their part need data that let them optimize decisions to
   maintain attentional preferences expressed by users who they act on
   behalf of.  What I am proposing is that instrumenting and
   augmenting user actions of attending, at the granularity of
   Tomasello's attentional skill primitives, provides the kind of data
   needed to expressively scaffold software agents.

   I call this approach "narrative process scaffolding" (Levy
   2018). The name and idea evolved in part from consideration of
   "robotic process automation" with which it shares the idea of
   agent-based interaction.  NPS differs from RPA in several ways, but
   primarily in that there is more substance to the definition of
   agents.  "Narrative" here refers to scaffolding capturing the
   directedness or motivatedness of attention toward its ends.
   Software agents are socially situated by means of attentional
   scaffolding and concrete instrumenting.  Scaffolding is expressed
   in terms of what I call "centers" as a way of giving names to
   game-like or utility-driven social contexts.  With respect to a
   center, scaffolding is expressed in the gestural language
   introduced above.  For example, I might share a center with a
   friend as way of involving them in what I'm doing, implying it
   might be worth their time.  If the friend is interested, they might
   follow-into that context.  When in the context, either of us might
   recommend that another center is of importance or helpful toward
   this center.  And then there is the decision to exit or continue,
   either out of boredom or due to success of some kind.  Whatever the
   case, we would like to keep track of this experience so that we can
   learn what works and repeat our successes, whether the "we" doing
   the work here is software agents or people.

** Attentional Resource Allocation

   Because a person's time spent attending is a scarce resource, the
   data of attending constitutes data on what is contextually
   important to a user.  Additionally, centers result in "getting
   somewhere", whether it be an advantageous state of possibility to
   attend to something else, an overtly conventional form of
   point-scoring, or a physical state change.  The context I envision
   for these peer exchanges is the notion of personal attention
   operating systems whereby software agents manage attentional
   resources in line with scaffolded objectives.  Individually it is
   in one's interests to have agents optimize the allocation of
   attention, and that is what such a system is for.  Between
   participants in social environments, a protocol for negotiating
   attentional objectives and tracking utility in processes of
   engaging together is what allows personal attention systems to be a
   nexus of socially situated computing.  I anticipate the reusable
   scaffolding exchanged resembling causal graphical models connecting
   attentional acts with utility of outcomes, in terms of what other
   centers or overtly abstracted social rewards (in either case to be
   potentially valued with the human user's personal attention system)
   they will tend to result in access to.

** Access to Abstraction

   Given an approach like NPS, we can see how conceptual metaphor and
   the gamut of linguistic constructions and language games are poised
   to become accessible to computing systems.  Today when we use a
   metaphor in a software abstraction, it goes a long way in
   establishing shared understanding of how to use it.  With the
   development of something resembling NPS, figurative meaning and
   figurative value in socially situated contexts can be captured
   functionally, allowing more comfortably fitting declarative claims
   to be staked out in our systems.

   The narrow prescription given here for "narrative process
   scaffolding" is still speculative and untested, but if it is
   developed into a robust practical computing paradigm, it is
   preferable over the formal propositional program that we have
   stated strong reasons to believe can't work.  NPS in contrast is
   guided by findings on how information content does appear to work.
   Further, if NPS turns out to be somehow irrecoverably flawed in its
   approach, it should be kept in mind that this is just one idea of
   how to design socially situated computing systems.  The space is a
   wide open frontier for creative and scientific exploration.

** Epilogue: A Third Cybernetics?

   I hope that I have been successful in making a case that socially
   situated computing is required for functional content awareness in
   computing systems.  The areas we've had to explore to get here are
   in many ways foreign to the wheelhouse of the majority of
   practicing engineers.  So a question arises, as to whether this can
   be successful.  I believe it can be successful, because once such
   idea are implemented in practice, their use will be very intuitive
   and accessible to a much wider audience than traditional
   programming has appealed to.  It will depend on execution and luck.
   However, if it is successful, this pragmatic turn in computing will
   be consistent with a broader trend I would identify as the early
   signs of a third cybernetics.

   The first cybernetics was an ambitious attempt to naturalize
   teleology and mechanize cognition.  Many of the most successful
   "AI" techniques today (neural networks, reinforcement learning,
   agents as dynamic control & feedback systems) began in that
   movement, which is ironic because AI and its attendant "cognitive
   revolution" arose in opposition to cybernetics.  The second
   cybernetics is identified with figures such as Francisco Varela,
   autopoiesis, autonomy, and enaction-- ideas that would, notably
   along with cybernetics' pragmatically turned cousin ecological
   psychology, come to dominate what remains of cognitive science,
   under the new heading of 4E Cognitive Science: embodied, embedded
   (situated), enactive, and extended (scaffolded).

   Today we see the early signs of a third wave of cybernetics
   emerging.  As discussed earlier, situated and socially situated
   computing is on the rise, there is renewed interest in and success
   of agent-based and agent-centered approaches in computing.  Giant
   companies pour research money into nebulous efforts toward
   "cognitive computing" as a goal of agent-based computing approaches
   such as robotic process automation.  There is new life being
   breathed into augmenting human agency, human-machine symbiosis, and
   intelligence amplification.  The promise of "the metaverse" (the
   situated internet) is being cultivated in emerging web standards
   for augmented reality on the open internet. And there is a great
   deal of activity on freeing users from centralized tech platforms,
   putting users back in the driver seat in terms of privacy and
   ownership of our own data.  This helps to make the prospect of
   socially situated metaverse more palatable and realizable given the
   depth and intimacy of integration of computing into personal and
   social experiences required.  It in many ways feels like the ideal
   setting for the emergence of socially situated computing.  We'll
   have to develop it out and see where it takes us.
